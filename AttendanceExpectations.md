# Expectations when attending 46120

46120 embraces hybrid teaching. Our goal is to facilitate equally high-quality learning to physical and online participants. Online participation is encouraged for all students, if it does not impact your learning.

Lecture times are at bottom of page.

## How you can attend

The teaching set-up is:  
 * A Virtual classroom on Zoom for online/remote students, facilitated by online TA  
    * We use breakout rooms (BORs) for small-group exercises during lecture
 * Classroom(s) on Lyngby campus for physical students  
    * For 2026, we have 3 physical classrooms that neighbor each other: 1) has the instructor and a TA, 2) is a streaming classroom with a TA, and 3) is overflow/groupwork space.


You choose how you want to attend. E.g., you could...
 * Be online but physically together with your group members at a remote location of your choice  
 * Be online by yourself at home  
 * Be physically present in one of the classrooms  

## Responsibilities/expectations when you attend

    * Be active during class, accept invitations to breakout rooms (BORs) promptly
